# Genesis

<p align="center">

</p>

**Born, Live, Climax.**

* A community comes to life when two or more individuals focus their energy on moving towards a **common direction**.
* To prosper, a community must include [**an economy**](#economy-and-its-philosophy) to **hierarchize** its **members** to the quality they share with the other ones.
* To thrive, a community must **include** members **actively working** to make real the ideas exchanged within the group.

A good contribution is qualified as such by the energy *(roughly: time * effort)* required for its design.

So, an influential individual within the community stands out from a so-called average individual, by the quality of the contributions they do. Thus, as in any group, the most motivated will be the most hard-working, and therefore the most recognized as a community's figure.

<br />

# Organization

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://siasky.net/CADN7mn_mwx8qT2oO6N-Gh5UAGnS6ayLIfvs0f4Ls9qNUA" width="100%">
</p>

A community needs a **fair** system to be **sustainable**:
- Open, where **everyone** have the ability to **commit** in the entity's evolution.

- Where contributors are **valued** according to the **relevance** they bring to the community's development.

- Where any direction took by the community is subject to a **general referendum** ([**Proposal**](#proposal))
  - Where the **value** of a member's vote is **proportional** to their [**Reputation**](#reputation) in the community.

- Where the creation of information ([**Thread**](#thread)) has **a cost** and **is rewardable**:
  - So the creation of information is **engaging** for the contributor and the **emission cost enhance** each member but also **dissuade** any harmful behavior (ex: spam, creators of trouble, stowaways, Sybil attacks). Writing to the community is a **risk-taking** that is rewarded with a **benefit** in positive feedback from the members or **a monetary loss** if negative feedback or lack of interest.
  - So the activity of the community is permanently **relative** to the orientation of **its social economy** because the community's consensus perpetually adjusts the **participation prices** in an [**Economical Proposal**](#example-of-an-economical-proposal).

# Communication

To communicate, the Involvera V1's communities have **two content creation models**, flexible thanks to the `markdown` layout format, which leaves members with significant freedom of ownership when they share with the community's people.

<br />

## Thread

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://siasky.net/CAB-q50SOIEh6VFXDmDKFeG8hWx8d1rlDxhVa6bGTwooOQ" width="100%">
</p>

The `Thread` represents the primary means of exchange of members of the community. It's a flexible section that can frame almost any type of content.

**What**: *An idea*, *a resource*, *a question*, *an article*, *a tutorial*, *to receive feedback* or *opinion*, *to debate*, or *an answer* to another thread.

**Design**: Neutral and simple

**Cost**: 100% of the thread's price voted in [**proposal**](#proposal) + variable equivalent to 2.5% of the thread's price additional for each line (filled with at least one character) it contains. (ex: a 14-line thread will cost 135% of the thread's price.)

Example of a few different thread formats.
</p>

### Features

##### UP/DOWN

**What**: Upvote allows member to support a thread, it helps a it to be better referenced. Downvote allow members to signal a low-quality content. (It can't be performed by very new members).

**Cost**: (**3%** of the thread's fixed cost)

*How the coins are spent?*
- 30% goes into the thread creator's wallet.
- 70% is burnt. (destroyed by the system)

**Example**: If a thread costs 100 coins to be performed, the upvote will cost 3 coins. (0.9 in the thread author's wallet, 2.1 is burnt)

<br />

##### REACTION

**What**: There may be times when members come across a thread that they like more than others and want to reward its author with something more valuable than an upvote.

**Cost**: There are three different ones, each having more consequent values than the others:
- ‚≠ê (**12%** of the thread's fixed cost)
- üí´ (**50%** of the thread's fixed cost)
- ‚ú® (**200%** of the thread's fixed cost)

*How the coins are spent?*
- 30% goes into the thread creator's wallet.
- 70% is burnt. (destroyed by the system)

**Example**: If a thread costs 100 coins to be performed, the üí´ 's reaction will cost 50 coins. (15 in the thread author's wallet, 35 are burnt)

<br />

## Proposal

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://siasky.net/CADHxKjLTzF-LaEWOgIvrD5K7emELV32TR2ZQ_tARKlZ8A" width="100%">
</p>

A `Proposal` makes it possible to propose a **direction** to the community. It is a proposed plan put to the vote of the members.

<br />

It can be:

### An Economic Proposal:

A proposal to **change** the **content** creation functions' **fixed costs**

### A Constitution Proposal:

A proposal to update the constitution (set of the rules) of the community.

### An Application Proposal:

A proposal to **develop** the **community's subject**.
e.g: Proposition to add/update/remove a feature on an open source software


<br />

___


<br />

**Design**: To avoid influences against a proposal, which must be judged only by its content, there is no direct reaction possible, regardless of the form.

The aim is to **focus the reader's attention** on the proposal's content and **not on any entertaining** comments that can easily manipulate **the vision that the author is sharing**.

However, community members can **open a thread to share opinions** about it. The threads created about the Proposal will still be accessible at the bottom of it.

**Life time**: A proposal has a maximum lifetime of **250 hours** (10.5 days) to find an outcome (majority of approvement or disapprovement).

**Cost**: 100% of the proposal's price voted in proposal + variable equivalent to **0.1%** of the proposal's price additional **for each line** (filled with at least one character) it contains. (ex: a 120-line proposal will cost 112% of the proposal's price.)

**Proposal rules**:
- If a proposal has **not reached a majority** of votes in favor of the allowed time, it is **canceled**.
- A proposal ends when the **time limit exceeded** or if **50% + 1** of the **total [reputation](#reputation)** is attached to a voting camp.
- If a proposal ends in time, the type of vote with the highest value vote wins.
- If the majority is **abstentionist**, the **second-largest** voting camp wins.
- If there is perfect equality between favorable and unfavorable, the proposal is canceled. The **unfavorable camp** always has **the advantage**.

<br />

<br />

### Features

##### VOTE

**What**: A proposal is dealt with by the vote of community members who have a reputation amount greater than 0.
The value of a vote is proportional to its creator's [**Reputation**](#reputation).

**Cost**: Free in Involvera V1.

There are 2 types of vote: **Favorable** and, **Unfavorable**.

<br />

# Economy

The economy is the backbone of an Involvera community.
It is the neutral and decentralized authority crystallizing how a community must move to continue its development.

<br />

## Currency

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://siasky.net/CADCBJAy5WRa8TFzObir4WrPowO4-zGWRYGGqH6Vm_k3xA" width="100%">
</p>

The economy of each community is based on its **unique currency**.

The economy is **cyclical** (1) and **expiring** (2):
1. The number of coins added to the economy every day is **constant**, **regular** and **never stops**.
2. Coins have a **programmed expiration** date when minted. They therefore **gradually lose** value until the day of their complete expiration when they are therefore no longer worth anything and is no longer exchangeable.

The self-regeneration cycle of a community's currency is carried out over **486.3 days** or **1459 Lugh transactions**.

<br />

### Lugh
A Lugh is a transaction adding **100,000 new coins** to the economy occurring **every 8 hours** forever. 
When a Lugh transaction is broadcasted, the value of all the circulating coins decrease by 1/1459 their value.

<br />


<br />

<br />

## Distribution

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://siasky.net/CADYIbmbDTxmtkxRFpAc8r68RRafObcdM7mpr4-n8hP2GQ" width="100%">
</p>

The 100,000 new coins added to the economy through LUGH transactions are algorithmically distributed to members of that economy according to their participation over the last 8 hours (between the previous LUGH and the current one).

<br />

### Based on the Threads activity

A thread posted to the community starts with a 0 score and increases when it gets a reaction or upvote from another user.
Two factors determine the amount added to the thread's score during a reaction/upvote:
1. The price of the reaction/upvote
2. The power vote amount of whoever reacts to the Thread.

<br />

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://siasky.net/PABD8lO1z_msriU_9jKvUlRn5tE66QdITEowHGH0MXNaGQ" width="70%">
</p>

*As long as the coin mining mechanism is not decentralized yet, 100% of the coins added to the economy during each LUGH will be distributed to community participation members after the previous LUGH. (last 8 hours)*

<br />

#### Example: Thread's reward calculation system

<br />

## Vote Power

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://siasky.net/CADwzfTcMHsAFYA6G6wtPswJxOLt6-BFzLvU_oeIP4qTxg" width="100%">
</p>

Vote Power is a **non-tradable value**, indexed on the social coins distributed by the system every day, as a reward for content creation.

It helps to **evaluate the importance** of a member and **its** total **contribution** within the system over **the last 486 days**. The reputation is ephemeral like the social coins, but **it expires suddenly** and not gradually like it.

Its circulating supply is equal to the number of coins distributed by the system to members during the last 486 days.

It **influences** Involvera‚Äôs algorithms:
- In **scoring content**
  - Content that has an impact on high-reputation members will score better than content that has an impact but on low-reputation members.
- In determining the value of **a proposal vote**
  - A Proposal's vote has the value of the reputation's issuer.

Reputation is useful to:
- Create a **justice system**.
  - A person with more **seniority** in a community will have **more influence** on decisions **than a young member**, who will have offered **less time** and **energy**.
- Determine the value of a proposal vote, proportional to the member‚Äôs reputation.
  - Thus making it possible to **remove any public offer of social coin purchase** by a group of individuals **to take power** over the outcome of a proposal, in the case of a voting value proportional to the number of social coins held. This would have led to possible manipulation of the power of the community by external financial means.

It is distributed every 8 hours to members of the community, (same time than the distribution of social coins)
Example: Someone who receives 200 coins as content creation rewards will also receive 200 reputation points.

## Philosophy

<p align="center">

> An information is obtained through a sensory exchange with the outside. It has the value of the projection it enables.

Understanding the process of creating and adopting information is too complex to be defined, but using this simple reasoning, we can conclude that one information **enables the creation** of other information(s). So it **represents** an **infinite chain** of ideas that bases the development of any entity.

**No link is more important** in a chain than the others; they are **all united** and **interdependent**. It means that a today‚Äôs fertile information can't inherently have more or less value than a yesterday's or tomorrow's information.

Adapting an inflationary economy (like all modern economies) to this system would lead to deep inequalities and, therefore, social conflicts taking origin from a different valuation of past, present, and future.

The ephemeral economy providing **a life** and **a death** cycle of **the currency**, perfectly meets the needs of a system aiming to optimize its growth and productivity speed by several points:

- The first, the most important and least palpable, is that the conception of such an economy, will cause the suppression of the fear of lack since the economic future is certain. Thus, **there will be no interest in storing** what has been previously accumulated.

- People working to obtain money know that they have a **limited time** to make **use** of **it**. They will have only two choices:
  - Use their coins to **pay for the features they need**, and if monetary surplus **redistribute** them into the economy **to support new ideas**. (e.g: Reaction / Upvotes)
  - **Exchange** their coins **with other members** to allow them to pay for the features, or to **help new people** to integrate the community.

- Since long-term currency storage is not possible, this will **reset the chances** with each complete **currency cycle**. The meritocracy will be absolute; the richest will be the **most deserving**, the most invested, the one able to make the best choices for the community's sustainability. Therefore, the richest will be entirely **legitimate** and **recognized** by the entire community. Their status, supported by the evidence of their investment, will be **traceable** and **visible** to the whole community.

<br />

To summarize:
* High inequalities do not exist since large currency reserves are impossible.
* There can be no storage of money and therefore, no energy waste.
* The redistribution of opportunities is then at its maximum level of exploitation.
* Quality of investment is then defined by what it proposes for the entity and its community, and not for personal interests.
